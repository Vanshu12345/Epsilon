                    <h2>Personalized Welcome Gifts</h2>
                    <p>This is one of the simplest hotel amenity ideas on this list, but it's also one of the easiest to execute. Use what you know about your guests to create a personalized welcome gift. During the booking process, you likely figured out why they’re visiting (business, vacation, in town for a bachelorette party, etc.) and you know if they’re traveling with family, kids, pets, or their partner.</p>
                    <p>If they’re traveling with kids, have kid-friendly treats, toys, or books in the room. If it’s a couple’s romantic weekend away, put together a small package of chocolate-covered strawberries and some champagne. Surprise them by having it waiting in their room for them when they arrive.</p>

                    <h2>Snack Baskets with Local Flavor</h2>
                    <p>Give guests a taste of your city by stocking rooms with a basket of snacks and drinks from local establishments. It gives you a chance to highlight the uniqueness of your destination while delighting guests with fun freebies. And, it’s a great way to plug your local small businesses and give them a boost. If you have a grab-and-go snack station in your lobby or a coffee shop, consider offering other, more robust varieties of local food and drink there as a for-purchase option.</p>

                    <h2>Coworking Spaces or In-Room Offices</h2>
                    <p>Business travelers, event attendees, or planners may need to get some work done during their stay. As such, offer friendly and open coworking spaces for those who like to work in a “coffee shop” type atmosphere. Make sure some rooms are equipped with desks for those who prefer to work in a quiet, private space.</p>

                    <h2>Free Bike Options</h2>
                    <p>If your destination is one that's bike-friendly, consider investing in a fleet of bikes for guest use. If you have the capabilities, offer a guided tour that leaves daily, or maybe on the weekends. It’s a great way to encourage guests to get active, go green, and see the best parts of your city at their leisure.</p>
                    <p>Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham offers a free bike share program that provides guests with a free bike, helmet, lock, and local map. Each bike has a bike basket for storing guests’ belongings or purchases while they’re out.</p>

                <div class="amenity-content">
                    <h2>Free Car Options</h2>
        <p>Ride share services are the norm, but what if you took it one step further? Offer guests a free ride in your hotel's car or SUV, like the Harvest Inn in Napa Valley, California, and take them anywhere within a reasonable radius of the hotel. Or, give them a free rental. The White Elephant in Nantucket, Massachusetts offers guests who book a particular suite a free BMW car rental to use during their stay.</p>

                    <h2>In-Room Beer Taps</h2>
<p>The DogHouse hotels are the first of their kind – a craft beer hotel where guests can sleep above a brewery. Their Columbus, Ohio location offers in-room draft beer and a mini fridge with a curated selection of the brewers’ favorite beers. If a beer tap isn’t something you can add in-room, consider stocking the fridge with staff favorites or local brews.</p>

                <div class="amenity-content">
                    <h2>In-Elevator or In-Room Bartenders</h2>
                    <p>Surprise guests with an in-elevator cocktail while they wait. Or, offer a personal bartending service where a mixologist will come to their room and make beverages for an additional charge. On Saturday evenings, the W Los Angeles – West Beverly Hills parks a miniature bar cart with a personal bartender in the elevator to create signature cocktails during the lift. At The Surrey in New York, a mixologist prepares drinks in-room and leaves behind enough ingredients and tools for 4-5 drinks so guests can try their hand at mixing their own. It’s an out-of-the-box way to provide a customized F&B experience while avoiding crowds and large gatherings.</p>

                    <p>Consider providing your guests with complimentary in-room board games or video games. It’s a great option for families, or for those who are kids at heart. Dorchester Collection hotels offer family games (and freshly-baked cookies), and Denver's The Curtis has a video game-themed room with board games and video games galore.</p>
